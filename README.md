> WARNING !!! the Electron app not show nothing if not execute before the react app!!

***In version v0.1.0 we optimized this with the command***:

```
npm run dev

```
For the ***"npm run dev"*** command to work and run both applications in parallel, the ***"npm-run-all"*** dependency must be installed first with the following command:

```
npm install npm-run-all --save-dev

```
